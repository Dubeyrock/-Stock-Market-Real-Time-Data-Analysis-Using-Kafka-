# Stock Market Kafka Real Time Data Engineering Project

## Introduction 
In this project, you will execute an End-To-End Data Engineering Project on Real-Time Stock Market Data using Kafka.

We are going to use different technologies such as Python, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Apache Kafka, Glue, Athena, and SQL.

## Project Description

The Stock Market Real-Time Data Analysis project aims to build a scalable and efficient data pipeline to process and analyze real-time stock market data using Apache Kafka and Amazon Web Services (AWS). This project enables businesses, traders, and analysts to gain real-time insights into stock market trends, price fluctuations, and trading patterns.

The system leverages Apache Kafka for real-time data ingestion and processing, while AWS services such as S3, Glue, Athena, and EC2 provide a cloud-based, serverless architecture for data storage and analysis. By integrating Kafka with AWS, we ensure seamless data flow, high availability, and cost-efficient query processing.

## Key Features

## Real-time Stock Market Data Ingestion: Fetching live stock prices and other financial metrics using Kafka Producers.

## Scalable Streaming Architecture: Processing high-frequency stock data using Kafka Consumers.

## Cloud Storage with AWS S3: Storing structured and semi-structured stock data for analysis.

## Automated Schema Detection: Using AWS Glue Crawlers and Glue Catalog for metadata management.

## SQL-Based Querying with AWS Athena: Running efficient queries on real-time and historical stock data.

## Flexible Deployment with AWS EC2: Hosting Apache Kafka and managing distributed data processing.
